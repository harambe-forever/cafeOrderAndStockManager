You have 3 different roles in the application where as you can be an admin, employer or an employee.
You can add new accounts in settings menu. When you're adding accounts, you also assign their roles.

Main Menu:

![mainMenu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71318378/148652342-a3af4e08-0b34-46c7-849b-2c7c88c5b912.png)

In main menu, you can choose between 4 different operations.
If you need to get back to the main menu, you need to click on the coffee icon at the corner.

Order:

You can either order to table, or buy shit to takeaway. So you need to clearify your needs first.
Then, you can add items to your basket just by clicking on them. ie:

After you save your table, on the tables menu you can see that your table data has been saved:

At this point you can add as much items to your table as you wish. But your payment is also increasing so be carefull with that lmao.
After you're done eating, simply click on the table you want to pay and click on pay button to make payment.

Or, you might as well just buy your shit and leave the restaurant. 
In this case you need to select takeaway option:

Inventory:
If you need to refill your inventory, simply click on the items you want to buy from supplier, clearify your quantity,
and select a shipment date for your orders:

You can either choose order now, or order to further date. In second case, your order will be transmitted to supplier  at the 
specified date that you pick. If you order now, a random order ID will be created and your order will be transmitted to supplier instantly.
